Each time a new requirement for the project was found, an issue was made to describe it. The issue would then be analysed and team members would be assigned to work on it. A new branch was made for the new requirements to be worked on, some issues would be assigned to the same branch, to make it easier to integrate them together. Members worked together using primarily pair programming. They would make a commit to the branch whenever necessary. When the issue was done, a pull request would be made. A team member that had not worked on the issue would then review it, and if it was approved, the branch would be merged into master. The issue would then be marked as done in the project  board.
